    <h1>"My Favorite City: Worcester, Massachusetts"</h1>


<body>
    <p>Worcester, pronounced wustah, is my favorite city because it is so quirky.
        Rocket ships and the Smiley Face were both invented here. People are not pretentious here.
        In fact, we are all just trying to survive and we recognize that and enjoy our
        imperfections. </p>
    <p>Worcester has always been a city of immigrants so the population and languages, the food and
        culture around you is very diverse here. Economically, it is also diverse.</p>
    <p>In the last several years, the city has been trying to gentrify Worcester. We now have trendy
        restaurants, beautiful murals, and some really nice places to walk and enjoy local nature
        and history.</p>
